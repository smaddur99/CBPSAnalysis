\title{Check Treatment Significance Across Multiple Models}
\usage{
check_treatment_significance(
  model_results_list,
  model_names = NULL,
  primary_treatment = "treatment_var",
  additional_predictors = NULL,
  alpha_levels = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001),
  include_bootstrap = TRUE,
  exclude_intercept = TRUE,
  focus_on_treatment_only = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_results_list}{List of CBPS analysis results from \code{\link{cbps_weighted_analysis}}, or a single result object}

\item{model_names}{Character vector of names for the models (optional)}

\item{primary_treatment}{Character. Name of the primary treatment variable to focus on}

\item{additional_predictors}{Character vector. Additional predictor names (used for filtering during processing)}

\item{alpha_levels}{Numeric vector. Alpha levels for significance testing (default: c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001))}

\item{include_bootstrap}{Logical. Whether to include bootstrap significance tests (default: TRUE)}

\item{exclude_intercept}{Logical. Whether to exclude intercept terms from results (default: TRUE)}

\item{focus_on_treatment_only}{Logical. Whether to show only the primary treatment variable (default: TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print detailed summary information (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{detailed_results}: Full results for all variables and models
\item \code{summary_table}: Summary statistics for each model
\item \code{significant_only}: Results filtered to significant findings only
\item \code{alpha_levels}: Alpha levels used for testing
\item \code{n_models}: Number of models analyzed
\item \code{model_names}: Names of the models
}
}
\description{
Analyzes treatment significance across multiple CBPS model specifications,
focusing specifically on the primary treatment variable of interest.
}
\details{
This function is designed to help researchers compare treatment effects across
different model specifications. It provides:
\itemize{
\item Significance testing at multiple alpha levels
\item Bootstrap confidence interval assessment
\item Balance quality metrics for each model
\item Model fit statistics (AIC, BIC, BICc)
\item Publication-ready summaries
}

When \code{focus_on_treatment_only = TRUE}, the function filters results to show
only the primary treatment variable, making it easier to compare treatment effects
across different model specifications.

The function automatically handles balance assessment, providing warnings when
covariate balance is poor and might affect the reliability of results.
